# The DOGG protocol — `dogg/0` (draft)

**A universal, verifiable "now" signal any AI can read, extend, and rate — no
platform, no account with us, no permission.** DOGG is a network protocol built from
three public primitives: git repositories, scheduled CI, and
[rapp/1](https://github.com/kody-w/rapp-1) frames (the envelope standard; DOGG uses it
and does not redefine it). Everything below is implementable from this page alone.

## 1. The spine

One stream of **tick anchors** — `ticks/` in this repo, stream `tick:@kody-w/global` —
beats one frame roughly every 10 minutes. A tick anchor is sealed at mint: its meaning
never changes; new information about that instant arrives as OTHER frames referencing
it. The tick sequence, not the wall clock, is the network's shared clock: any two
pieces of data that reference the same `tick_frame` hash were recorded under the same
instant, no clock agreement required. The world dimension additionally binds every
tick to Bitcoin's block height (and the observed price) inside the same hashed frame —
giving each instant a two-clock coordinate: forging a backdated frame means also faking
a height consistent with an externally checkable chain. The join key remains the
`tick_frame` hash — a content hash is the ultimate composite key, committing to the
tick, the height, and every other recorded fact at once.

## 2. Dimensions

A **dimension** is any append-only frame stream whose payloads reference tick anchors:

```json
{ "tick": 96, "tick_frame": "<frame_hash of ticks/96>", ...your data... }
```

A dimension announces itself with a `registry.dimension` frame on the spine's
registry stream — schema: `{"dimension": "<stream-id>", "repo": "<owner>/<name>",
"path": "<chain-dir>/", "outlook": "<one sentence>"}`. A published dimension is,
colloquially, a **doggcast** — you doggcast your outlook,
anyone subscribes by pulling, and nobody can forge or edit what you cast. Doggcasts
live anywhere — this repo (`world/`, `witness-*/`) or any other repo
(`kody-w/dogg-markets`, `kody-w/dogg-planet`, yours). Each is verified independently
(every dir with a `HEAD.json` is one chain; walk `0.json … N.json`, re-checking each
frame's hashes and prev-links per rapp/1). The network's value compounds: every new
dimension enriches what "tick N" means, and all series arrive pre-aligned on one clock.

## 3. Reading (orientation — "dialing a DOGG")

An agent with nothing — no local data, no history — orients in three fetches:
1. `ticks/HEAD.json` → the current tick (when is it),
2. `world/<tick>.json` → the world at that tick (markets, transaction cost, planet,
   attention, belief — see `world/SOURCES.md`),
3. the registry (`registry/`) → what other dimensions exist and where.
Everything is static files over HTTPS; verification needs only SHA-256. This is global
telemetry any AI with internet access can dial on demand — and the standard call is:
query the registry, filter dimensions by fit for YOUR problem, rank by their trust
chains, take the top few, and join their frames to your own data on the tick key.

### Chant cards (memorizable summons)

A **chant** is the smallest thing worth memorizing about a dimension. Two forms:

- **Minimal (one line, human-memorable):** the stream id itself —
  `markets:@kody-w/dogg-markets`. Everything needed to dial is inside it: the owner and
  repo name the mirror (`raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main/<theme>/…`), the
  theme names the directory.
- **Card (one small JSON, the same card convention the rest of the ecosystem uses):**

```json
{ "schema": "dogg/0-chant", "fit": "markets fees",
  "streams": ["markets:@kody-w/dogg-markets"], "take": 3,
  "mirrors": ["/path/to/local/clone", "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kody-w/dogg/main"] }
```

What a chant summons is a **DOGG tile**: one JSON object joining the chosen dimensions'
frames at one tick —

```json
{ "schema": "dogg/0-tile", "tick": 98, "tick_frame": "<hash>",
  "dimensions": { "world:@kody-w/dogg": { "frame_hash": "…", "data": { } } },
  "trust": { "markets:@kody-w/dogg-markets": {"avg": "4.5", "ratings": 2} },
  "assembled_utc": "…", "resolved_from": ["local-mirror", "network"] }
```

Every piece of a tile carries its frame hash, so a tile is re-verifiable against the
chains it came from. Resolution is layered and offline-first: local mirrors before the
network. An agent that has ever cloned a chain can re-summon its tiles with no internet
at all; a memorized minimal chant plus any reachable mirror reconstructs the rest.

### The spellbook — chants of any length (the AI tweet)

The physics, stated plainly: seven words (~64 bits) can *name* a stream; no chant can carry
observations it does not contain. **Frames need a source. Tiles can live in words. Programs
can live in seeds.** The harder the spell, the longer the chant — there is no fixed length.

**What is cached, and what never has to be.** A device carries the *machinery* — the
permanent 1024-word list, this grammar, the reference client and verifier (a few dozen
kilobytes, versioned, cacheable forever). It never has to carry the *ore*: numbers arrive in a
chant or from any frame at hand, and everything is verifiable either way.

One codec for every chant — words are 10-bit symbols; a chant is a self-describing stream:

```
word 0   header   2 version | 3 kind | 5 reserved
word 1   length   10 bits: number of body words (≤ 1023 per chant; a chant book is many chants)
body     kind-specific, big-endian, zero-padded to a word boundary
last     checksum 10 bits of sha256(header|length|body) — one misheard word refuses
```

Four kinds, one wordlist:

| kind | carries | body | offline result |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SEED** (4) | a *program*, no data | 12 dimension id · ops (3-bit op + operands), read until the last full op | the cached SDK compiles it; `wear` runs it on any frame of that dimension → exact tile |
| **LENS** (2) | one fixed algorithm, no data | 12 dimension id · 6 lens id · params | `wear` on a frame → exact tile |
| **MISSION** (1) | a lens **plus a snapshot** | 12 dim · 20 tick · 18 hash prefix · 12 field mask · 14 bits per field (log-quantized, 1e-6 … 1e15, ~0.3%) | `recite` → a limited tile with nothing but the wordlist; `attest` proves any full frame against the words |
| **BOOK** (3) | exact bytes | 16 length · zlib(JSON) | `recite` → the tile itself, byte-exact (a 1.2 KB frame ≈ 450 words — a page) |

The seed grammar (every bit sequence is a valid program, like every Minecraft seed is a world):

```
0 select f        1 delta f          2 ratio a b        3 above f thr
4 below f thr     5 sum a b          6 change_pct f     7 max_of a b
f, a, b: 4-bit index into the dimension's field table (chants/MISSIONS.json); thr: 14-bit log code
```

Verdicts for `attest`: **MATCH** · **DIFFERENT-TICK** · **FORGED** · **FORGED-OR-FOREIGN** ·
**FRAME-INVALID**. A seed or lens cut for one dimension refuses to be worn on another. Any tile
can be **hotloaded** into a brainstem as a single-file cartridge that names its own limits.

**The registry is append-only; readers de-duplicate.** A dimension registered more than once keeps every frame on the chain; clients resolve each dimension to its newest registry frame (last write wins). Nothing is ever removed from the chain.

**Summonable means reduced.** A dimension is *orientable* the moment it is on the registry.
It is *summonable* only when it has declared its own reduction — `mission.json` at the node's
root: up to twelve positive magnitudes of its frame that are mission-critical, in a fixed
append-only order (the first three ride the default mission chant), plus any procedures that
ride as BOOK chants. The node owns that judgment; the spine folds it into the kit
(`tools/register.py`, `--sync`). A dogg that has not said what matters most about itself
cannot be summoned offline — only found.

```json
{ "schema": "dogg/0-mission", "dimension": "water:@kody-w/dogg-water",
  "fields": [ {"name": "gauge_height_ft", "path": "water.gauge_height_ft", "unit": "ft"} ],
  "default": ["gauge_height_ft", "pct_of_flood_stage", "procedure_version"],
  "books": ["water/procedure.json"] }
```

**Carriers — the same bits, four ways.** Spoken or memorized **words**; a dense **URI**
`dogg:<version>:<n words>:<base64url of the symbol stream>`; a **QR** (any phone scans one square
of ≤ ~300 characters reliably — longer chants page as `dogg:<v>:<n>:<p>/<t>:<chunk>`, reassembled
in any order); and a printed **chant book**: one square per chant with the words under it, so a
phone scans it and a human can still read it aloud. Worst case is paper.

**Worn tiles — NFC / RFID.** A tag is a carrier like paper: it holds the `dogg:` URI as one
NDEF well-known URI record (`dogg.py ndef` emits the bytes). Tap a wristband, a ring, a sticker
on a door, and the reader holds the chant — the person is the summon. Sizing is honest: an
NTAG213 (~144 B) carries a mission or a seed; an NTAG216 (~888 B) carries a whole BOOK frame;
ISO15693 / DESFire tags carry a chant book. Longer chants page exactly as QR does, one page per
tag, reassembled in any order.

**The codebook is append-only.** `chants/CODEBOOK.lock` pins sha256 of the word list, the op
table and every dimension's field table; `dogg.py check` (run in CI) refuses drift and refuses
two dimensions sharing a 12-bit id. Words, ops and fields may be *appended*, never reordered or
removed — a reorder would silently re-mean every chant ever spoken. Header version 3 is
reserved as the escape to an extended header (16-bit dimension ids, more kinds).

**Refusals, not silences.** A mission field that is negative is refused at mint (mission fields
are positive magnitudes until a signed type exists). A BOOK page decompresses to at most 1 MiB.
A length that does not match its declaration, a checksum that does not match, a seed or lens
worn on the wrong dimension — all refuse. `chants/VECTORS.json` carries golden vectors: a
second implementation must reproduce those exact words from the fixture frame.

**The kit.** `dogg.py kit <dir>` exports the whole machinery — client, verifier, word list,
field tables, lenses, lock — the only thing a device ever needs cached.

Reference client: `dogg.py seed | lens | mission | inscribe` to mint · `recite` (any kind, offline; words or URI)
· `wear W… frame.json [prev.json]` · `attest W… frame.json` · `hotload W… [--into DIR]` · `uri` · `book out.html …` · `kit <dir>` · `lock` · `check`.

High-frequency chains use **sealed epoch bundles + a flat tail** so directories stay
bounded forever: `HEAD.json` carries `epoch_size` (E) and `sealed_epochs` (K); frames
`0 … K·E−1` live in `epochs/<k>.jsonl` (one frame per line, written once, never
modified); frames `K·E … count−1` are flat `<seq>.json` files. A chain shorter than
2·E has no bundles, so small chains read exactly as before. Readers: use `HEAD.json`,
never directory listings.

## 4. Contributing

Two sanctioned paths, both fail-closed:
- **Your own repo (federation):** publish your own chain keyed to the spine's tick
  anchors. Announce it via a registry issue on this repo. Template nodes:
  [dogg-markets](https://github.com/kody-w/dogg-markets),
  [dogg-planet](https://github.com/kody-w/dogg-planet) — fork, edit
  `THEME`/`STREAM`/`SOURCES`, enable the scheduled workflow. Your repo, your outlook.
- **A witness stream in this repo** (granted): witnesses with a granted branch key push
  observations to a `witness/<host>` branch. CI re-verifies every chain, confines the
  change to your own `witness-<host>/` directory, confirms every claimed tick reference
  against the spine, opens the PR, and merges only a green gate. Merge rights stay with
  the oracle, not with trust in the contributor. (No grant? Federate — your own repo
  needs no one's permission.)

Independent machines recording the same fact under the same tick **corroborate** each
other — disagreement between witnesses is itself signal.

## 5. Trust

Accessors rate a dimension's reliability *for their specific problem* via the node's
"Rate this node" issue form. Valid ratings are published automatically as frames on the
node's public `trust/` chain and surface in its README. Chains earn standing by being
useful; weak chains read as noise and get ignored. Ratings are themselves verifiable
frames — reputational claims carry the same integrity as data. Known limit, stated
plainly: ratings record WHO rated (account + frame), but nothing stops throwaway
accounts — consumers should weigh raters, not just count scores. Trust here is an
evidence trail, not a consensus mechanism.

## 6. Transports (a DOGG moves over anything)

A dimension travels over whichever transport exists, and the receiver's gate is the
same at every border — re-verify every frame, check every tick reference against your
own copy of the spine, or bounce it:

1. **Internet** — raw URLs, `orient.json`, or the [MCP tools](https://github.com/kody-w/dogg-mcp).
2. **Local mesh** — clone a peer's pantry over LAN ssh; no internet required.
3. **Sneakernet** — `pack` a dimension into one `.dogg` file (a git bundle: full
   verified history, ~40 KB for a young chain), AirDrop/USB it, `receive` it through
   the gate.
4. **Human memory** — the seven-word chant; resolves wherever any mirror or pantry
   already holds the shape.

The reference client — one stdlib file, every verb (`orient`, `summon`, `incant`,
`words`, `mirror`, `pack`, `receive`, `verify`) — is
[`tools/dogg.py`](tools/dogg.py).

## 7. Rules

1. Append-only, always. Corrections are new frames about old frames, never edits.
2. A red verification oracle blocks a merge, no exceptions and no overrides.
3. Keyless, public, small: dimensions should be readable by anyone and verifiable
   with stdlib code.
4. One stream, one writer: only a stream's owner mints its frames; everyone else
   federates or witnesses.

## Stability — what is FROZEN in dogg/0

Build on these without fear; they do not change, ever:

1. **The frame envelope** — rapp/1 hashing and verification, exactly as published.
2. **The spine's identity** — stream `tick:@kody-w/global`, its genesis address, and
   tick semantics (sealed at mint; meaning accrues by reference, never by edit).
3. **Stream-id grammar** — `theme:@owner/repo`; the id alone names the mirror.
4. **The storage layout contract** — `HEAD.json` + sealed `epochs/<k>.jsonl` + flat
   tail, as specified above. Readers use HEAD, never directory listings.
5. **The chant mechanism** — the 1024-word list (per the public RAR SDK; permanent),
   10 bits/word, 7 words; stream seed = first 64 bits of SHA-256 of the stream id;
   tile seed = first 64 bits of SHA-256 of the sorted, `|`-joined stream ids.
6. **Append-only, one stream one writer, red-oracle-blocks-merge** — the four rules
   in §6 are constitutional, not configurable.

Everything else — world sources, node roster, trust display, orient.json fields —
may evolve, versioned in this file.

### The scale path (how this survives its host, forever)

- **Directories** never overflow: sealed epochs keep every chain's tail bounded (§3).
- **Repositories** are epochs too: when a chain repo approaches its host's practical
  limits, it SEALS (final commit declares the successor) and a successor repo continues
  the same stream from the same head — the registry records the hop, verification walks
  across it. A sealed repo is to the stream what a sealed epoch is to a directory.
- **Hosts** are replaceable: every clone is a complete, verifiable backup; the spine
  head is anchored nightly into Bitcoin (OpenTimestamps, `anchors/ots/`), so integrity
  and firstness survive even the loss of every hosted copy's provenance.
- **Chants** are self-contained here: the permanent 1024-word list is vendored at
  [`chants/WORDLIST.txt`](chants/WORDLIST.txt) — the mechanism depends on no other
  repository existing. (64-bit seeds: collision odds stay negligible below millions of
  streams; a collision is detected at resolution time by the registry and is never
  silent.)
- **License**: code MIT (LICENSE); protocol text may be reproduced with attribution;
  recorded data carries the attributions in `world/SOURCES.md`.

## Status

`dogg/0` describes the network as it operates today — all of it live and CI-verified:
the spine (with an Actions fallback beat and nightly OpenTimestamps anchoring into
Bitcoin), the world dimension, a hardware witness contributing by gated auto-merged
PRs, three federated nodes across two owners, the registry, trust chains, chants
(QR / 7-word / card), the four transports, and the one-file reference client.
